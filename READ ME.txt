1) Download OPENCV file in your computer.(I downloaded version 4.5.2)
2) Install Visual Studio Community version 2019.
 -> while installing make sure you select the option Development with c++.

3)After Completing the above 2 process, open Visual Studio and:
 -> Create Empty Project
 -> Add the RESOURCE File inside it.
 -> Paste the Code in .cpp file. (run it and enjoy)


NOTE: You will need to add path for various file , so it's better for you to go and 
      search on youtube "How to setup Visual Studio for OPENCV C++"
